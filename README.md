**Abstract**: Globally, marine herbivorous fish follow a general trend of decreasing species diversity and abundance towards the poles/cold-water regions. We investigated whether individual body condition and diet varied with temperature in temperate southern Australia for two herbivorous species with different temperature affinities and foraging strategies, _Aplodactylus arctidens_, a long-term resident and _Olisthops cyanomelas_, a recent warming-related arrival. We explored gut fullness, gut contents, and body condition in both species across a winter/summer temperature range of 12 – 18 °C. Body size was a key predictor of gut fullness, with a positive, non-linear relationship found for both species. Temperature had an additional, positive, non-linear effect on the relationship between fish body size and gut fullness.  The cool/cold-water affinity _A. arctidens_ consumed a higher proportion of red algae, while the warm/cool affinity _O. cyanomelas_ appeared to specialise on common brown algae. Diet differences between these species likely contributes to their temperature affinities and thermal niches. Coupled with body size, _A. arctidens_ appears to be a more active winter herbivore, compared to _O. cyanomelas_, in cold water. Dietary and digestion mechanisms may promote the range extension of herbivorous fish (such as, smaller-bodied _O. cyanomelas_) to higher latitudes by facilitating increased efficiency of metabolic pathways.
